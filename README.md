**Trading trends using time series anaylsis:**
About the project: It is Crucial to predict stock price movements for investors and finance companies. In our project we will be using some prediction models to aid in stock prediction using NASDAQ Data.

Financial trading is a complex task. The trading decision to buy and sell requires a great deal of knowledge and the capability to make the right decision at the right time.

This research will explore various machine learning algorithms equations including deep learning for this task.

**About the Data:**

**Market:** NASDAQ

**Companies:** Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and more

**Time Span Covered:** 1980-2022 (42 years)

**Data points per Company:** 10,000

**Total Data Points:** 07 Million

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data


**ARIMA Model:**
Commonly used method for analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data.

Three components - the autoregressive (AR) component, the moving average (MA) component, and the integrated (I) component.

The logic behind the ARIMA model is to identify and model patterns in time series data that can be used to make forecasts

**Findings:**

Foreign Exchange and Interest rate are critical factors that can aid in analysis of economic and market conditions. 

ARIMA Model  is time-dependent hence it is unable to utilize the information that can be obtained via the above mentioned critical factors.
